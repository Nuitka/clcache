Being an open source project, clcache greatly benefits from many people contributing to the project. Contributions can come in many forms, e.g.

* Pull requests
* Code reviews
* Ideas

  However, please note that there are many users of clcache with different needs -- some use the Visual Studio IDE, others don't. Some have a CMake-based build system, others use plain batch files. Some build with many concurrent invocations, others don't. Hence, every change to the program should be carefully evaluated.
